//  ────────────────────< Main Arsenik configuration >─────────────────

// Below are a bunch of options to quickly customize the Arsenik keymap. You
// can pick and choose them by (un)commenting the different `#define`
// declarations.

#define ENABLE_SYMBOLS_LAYER
/* When active, gives access to the programming symbols layer used by layouts
 * like Ergo‑L and all of the "Lafayette" familly of layouts (it's their AltGr
 * layer). The definition of this layer depends on the keyboard layout you are
 * using, so make sure to select the correct one in the list bellow.
 *
 * When inactive, this layer is discarded and replaced by AltGr.
 */

// #define ENABLE_HRM
/* When active, adds a Meta, Ctrl and Alt home-row-mod on respectively s/l,
 * d/k or f/j on a Qwerty keyboard. Those home-row-mods stay on those exact
 * keys regardless of the layout being used, meaning they would be on r/i, s/e
 * and t/n on a Colemak keyboard.
 */

// #define MAC_MODIFIERS
/* Swaps around home-row-mods from Meta, Ctrl, Alt to Alt, Meta, Ctrl, as it
 * may make more sense on a Mac, like to keep common shortcuts accessible with
 * the Ergo‑L layout, for instance
 *
 * (Requires `ENABLE_HRM`)
 */

// #define SIMPLE_THUMBS
/* When active, uses an extra simple config without any tap-holds on the thumb
 * keys. It may be a *lot* simpler to use, but requieres a keyboard with at
 * least 6 thumb keys (so 3 per thumb) instead of 3 thumb keys total and is
 * overall a lot less efficient (especially when combining modifiers).
 *
 * Base thumb config: LSFT_T(KC_ESC)  LT(_num_nav, KC_SPC)  RALT_T(KC_ENT)
 * When it's active: KC_ALT  KC_CTL  KC_GUI     MO(_num_nav)  KC_SPC  KC_RALT
 * (KC_RALT becomes the `_symbols` layer if `ENABLE_SYMBOLS_LAYER`
 * is active)
 *
 * (Prevents using `VIM_NAVIGATION`)
 */

// #define VIM_NAVIGATION
/* Most ergonomic keyboards have at least 4 comfortable thumb keys keys (so 2
 * per thumb). Selenium is a variant of Arsenik made to fit on 34 keys keyboard
 * to take advantage of the extra thumb key. It does it by splitting the numbers
 * and navigation layers to 2 distict layers, and adds an escape key.
 *
 * Base thumb config: LSFT_T(KC_ËSC)  LT(_num_nav, KC_SPC)  RALT_T(KC_ENT)
 * Selenium: LSFT_T(KC_ESC) LT(_num_row, KC_BSPC) LT(_vim_nav, KC_SPC) RALT_T(KC_ENT)
 */

// #define LEFT_HAND_SPACE
/* Swaps around the backspace and space keycodes, for people who prefer using
 * their left thunb for the space bar.
 *
 * (Requires `VIM_NAVIGATION`)
 */

#define RESTORE_SPACE
/* Having Space accessible to only one thumb may create some problems, especially
 * when trying to type Shift + Space or Lafayette / AltGr + Space (depending if
 * your space key is on your left or right hand). When active, backspace gets
 * temporarily replaced by space when the original space key is held.
 *
 * (Requires `VIM_NAVIGATION`)
 */

// Lists of layouts supported by Arsenik. Some parts of the config are dependent
// on keyboard layout used on your computer. If they don't match up some
// characters may not be correctly placed or missing entirely. If multiple
// options are toggled at the same time, the first one is chosen.
